### Link to application
https://covid-19-react-application-mickey-english.netlify.app/

## Brief
Produce a pice of work that visualises the number of Covid 19 cases across London over time.

### How to run the application on Mac, Linux and Windows  

1. Clone the GitHub Repository by entering  ``` git clone <link-to-repository> ``` in terminal. Or download the zip folder by clicking download zip. 
2. Extract the zip file.
3. Navigate to the app directory in your terminal/cmd line application. \
``` cd React-covid-test ```
5. Run npm install to install the application.  
 ``` npm install ```
7. Run npm start to start the server on localhost://3000. \
  ``` npm start ```
9. If your browser doesn't open automatically when running the above command, open a browser of your choice and enter http://localhost:3000/ in the address bar to launch the application.

## About

The application is built using React.js and is comprised of 3 main components: Cases box, sidebar and the main section, which includes the charts. On the first render, the data is converted from a raw CSV file to a JavaScript Array which is then used to filter the selected area (Borough name). The user can view 3 chart types: Line, Bar and area chart. The charts show the number of daily cases and total cases in the selected borough from a given timeline. The user has the option to filter the dates by 1 week, 1 month and 3 months. The cases box is dynamic and will update as the boroughs name are changed. The user can search for a borough using the search box which will then filter the borough names and display the key data from the selected London borough.

### challenges

Since the CSV file is quite large, I noticed the application was running quite slow on each render. For this reason, I used UseMemo and useCallback to cache the results. Otherwise, each time the application renders, it would have to convert the CSV to JavaScript each time which is expensive and will result in a slow performance web application.

### If I had more time, I would have updated the following:

1. Researched and implemented more in-depth accessibility best practices.
2. Add animations using Framer motion or three.js.
3. Add a geographical map to show the data in each of the London Boroughs in a more visually pleasing way.
4. Add unit tests.
5. Use a state library to manage the application state such as React-context.
